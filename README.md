#clean-responsive
================
This is a basic webstack based on webapp2 and python. This includes html, css, js libraries, and server side code.


#### Features:
* Simple semantic markup
* Responsive design using CSS3 flexboxes.
* Designed around Google AppEngine, but can be adapted to any webapp2, python implementation.

#### Demo site:

#### Libraries:

#####Responsive Nav (http://responsive-nav.com/)
https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js

#####SlidesJS (http://slidesjs.com/)
https://github.com/nathansearles/Slides/tree/SlidesJS-3

*Slightly modified to allow for reordering of pagination. I wanted to have < 1 2 3 4 >; where the arrows represent the links to the previous and next slides, and the numbers indicate the current page and allow for jumping to a page.

Under the current implementation only < > 1 2 3 4 is possible. Both versions are provided.

#####Roboto Font (https://www.google.com/fonts)
